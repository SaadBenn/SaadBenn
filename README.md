# About Me
👋 My name is Saad, and I work as a Software Engineer. I like building things and teams. I am largely interested in distributed systems and devops. Aside from my day job as a SWE, I also work as a freelancer and have contributed to products for several startups, mostly in the NodeJS, GraphQL, TypeScript, and Golang and Java ecosystems. I also love teaching and have over 2 years of experience as a Teaching Assistant for CS courses. I believe solving problems > design > coding > languages & frameworks.

I try to spend most of my time with my family but when I am not with them, you will find me boxing, hooping or playing tennis  🥊 🏀  🎾 

# Goals for 2023
+ Delve more into the convoluted concepts of Backend developement and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). 
+ Work on architectural designs and data intensive applications. 
+ Contribute to more open source projects that I use. I want to contribute to all the main parts of my tech stack.
