# About Me
👋 My name is Saad, and I work as a Software Engineer. I am largely interested in distributed systems and devops. I also work as a freelancer and have contributed to products for several startups, mostly in the NodeJS, GraphQl and TypeScript ecosystems. Aside from that, I have over 2 years of experience as a Teaching Assistant for CS courses. I believe solving problems > design > coding > languages & frameworks.

When I am not working, you will find me boxing or hooping. 🥊 🏀  

# Goals for 2021
+ Understand more convoluted concepts of Backend developement and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). 
+ Work on architectural designs and data intensive applications. 
+ Contribute to more open source projects that I use. I want to contribute to all the main parts of my tech stack.
+ Travel more and visit friends I've made through open source in the Bay Area, Toronto, Seattle, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Los Angeles.
