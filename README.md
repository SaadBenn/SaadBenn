# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ My name is Saad, and I work as Software Engineer.

In my free time I work on my personal projects but I also work as a freelancer and have built products for several startups using Django, GraphQL, and Java. I also work on a number of other open source projects, mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems. 

# Goals for 2021
+ Understand more convoluted concepts in the realm of backend developement. 
+ Work on architectural designs and build data intensive applications. 
+ Contribute to more open source projects that I use. I want to contribute to all the main parts of my tech stack.
+ Travel more and visit friends I've made through open source in San Francisco, Toronto, Seattle, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Los Angeles. (Obviously once COVID is over)
